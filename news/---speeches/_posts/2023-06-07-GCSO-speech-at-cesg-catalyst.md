#### Opening Address by Mr Lim Tuang Liang, Government Chief Sustainability Officer, at the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore Catalyst 2023 on 7 June 2023

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon. Thank you for
joining us today for the CleanEnviro Summit Singapore Catalyst 2023.

Key Takeaways from COP27 For Singapore

2 Climate change is our greatest challenge today. It is no longer a distant threat but a reality that we must manage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned, in the final part of its sixth assessment report, that the world faces irreversible global warming unless much more is done. This was reiterated again by the World Meteorological Organisation in its Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update. It further warned that global temperatures are likely to surge to record levelsin the next five years, even temporarily breaching the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark. We are already observing impacts of extreme climate events on communities all over the globe.

3 It boils down to one simple message: act now, or we will face increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts. It is a stark reminder that we must take real, discernible, and urgent actions.

4 As a low-lying island city-state, Singapore is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and extreme weather events. It is an understatement when I say that Singapore understands the exigencies of climate change.

5 In the lead-up to COP27 last year, we raised our climate ambition significantly and committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We submitted an addendum
to our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy to include this new goal. We have also enhanced our climate pledge as part of our commitment towards
global action on climate change and will now reduce our emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030 after peaking emissions earlier. How will Singapore get there?

6 The theme for CESG Catalyst this year is “Towards a Low Carbon and Just Transition”. “Low Carbon” because we need to transition towards this future or face devastating climate impacts. “Just” because transitions are disruptive. We need to ensure that all segments of society can benefit from it. To achieve our climate
ambitions, we need to strengthen three key enablers.

Financing Singapore’s Green Transition

7 One, financing the green transition. This is a crucial enabler, as decarbonisation will come at a cost. An estimated US$4 to US$6 trillion a year is needed for the global transformation to a low-carbon economy. Asia alone will require US$3 trillion a year.

8 Financing will be needed to develop low-carbon technologies, support new sustainable projects and “green” existing infrastructure in all sectors. Singapore has
invested early in low-carbon energy technologies. S$55 million was awarded to projects under the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative to develop solutions in hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage. An additional S$129 million will be set aside for Phase 2 of the funding initiative.

9 Complementing investments into low-carbon technologies is our carbon tax. A carbon tax is necessary. It induces the entire economy to reduce demand for carbon-
intensive goods and services. It enhances the business case to fund and commercialise low-carbon technologies, improving the competitiveness of our economy and enterprises in the low-carbon future.

10 The carbon tax forms part of Singapore’s comprehensive suite of mitigation measures and is a key enabler for our net zero goal. To move decisively towards it,
we announced that we will raise our carbon tax levels progressively to S$50 to S$80 (or about US$37 to US$58) per tonne of carbon by 2030. The revenue from carbon
tax will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a green economy, and cushion the impact on businesses and households.

11 However, the financial investments needed to support the net zero transition is too large to be taken on by the public sector alone. We will need to work closely with the private sector to mobilise much more.

12 The development of carbon markets can be a key driver to finance the green transition. Well-functioning carbon markets would help unlock financing for emissions reduction and removal projects globally. Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, countries can also cooperate through carbon markets to support the raising of global climate ambition, whilst supporting sustainable development and bringing down the cost of technologies and solutions over time. Under Singapore’s International Carbon Credits framework, carbon tax liable companies will have the option to tap on eligible international carbon credits to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions, in lieu of paying carbon tax.

Corporate Transparency

13 This brings me to the second enabler that we must strengthen: Corporate Transparency. Carbon markets must deal with the risk that the carbon credits traded
are not of high environmental integrity and do not represent actual emissions reductions.

14 Singapore’s International Carbon Credits framework will ensure that the carbon credits surrendered by companies are of high environmental integrity and in
compliant with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. It will be underpinned by a set of robust criteria that is aligned with international rules to ensure that the carbon credits represent real, tangible emissions reductions. It will address concerns of permanence and double counting of carbon credits and build trust in the system.

15 Companies should also embrace a culture of corporate transparency to build trust in sustainability reporting. Sustainability reporting is key to examine our current means of operation and identify opportunities to improve. The Government will take the lead by publishing an annual GreenGov.SG report from this financial year onwards. We will start by reporting Scope 1 and 2 emissions, electricity, and water consumption, with reference to international standards and frameworks. The report will chart the public sector’s efforts, progress and plans to achieve net zero around 2045.

16 The call on governments and companies to increase transparency over climate targets and implementation plans will only get stronger. High-quality and
reliable climate-related disclosures will empower us to make impactful changes and build trust with our stakeholders.

Workforce Transformation

17 The third enabler is Workforce Transformation. Workforce Transformation is key to transit to a just and low-carbon economy. Singapore’s net zero transition will require our workforce to adapt and transform. The innovations to be built for a low-carbon world will require not just technological investment, but also of equal importance, investment in people.

18 Under the SG Green Plan 2030, we will transform existing sectors and help them decarbonise. This includes our Energy and Chemicals sectors, which have
been key pillars of Singapore’s development and their transformation will be crucial in helping us achieve our long-term climate ambitions.

19 As we shift towards a green economy, we must equip our people with new skills and knowledge so that no one is left behind. There will be new jobs created in
many sectors, such as environmental services, renewable energy, and sustainable finance. It is therefore essential for us to invest in skills development in these
emerging domains under the green economy, empowering individuals to thrive in green jobs. The Green Skills Committee, which SkillsFuture Singapore is working
with the Ministry of Trade and Industry on to connect industries with training providers, is one such example. This initiative will help to develop green skills in the local workforce that are relevant to industry needs.

20 Companies in all economic sectors will also need to build capabilities in key domains such as sustainability reporting, carbon management and waste
management. Enhancing corporate capabilities in these fields and having a workforce that is ready to take on roles in these domains, will enable companies in
Singapore to seize new opportunities and develop new processes or products.

21 The launch of the Enviro Tech Innovation Hub later today is an example of the efforts we are taking to equip our workforce with the skills necessary in a green
economy. This is a collaboration between Temasek Polytechnic, Environmental Management Association of Singapore, LS2 Holdings, Republic Power, Cleantools, Kärcher 1 and Nilfisk. The Hub will drive local capability development in the Environmental Services industry through facilitated training and coaching
programmes. These programmes would be validated collectively by government agencies, institutes of higher learning and trade associations.

22 The Government will continue to partner businesses and workers to foster a conducive environment to adapt and take advantage of these opportunities.

Next Steps for Singapore

23 For Singapore to thrive in a low-carbon future, we need collective efforts across all sectors of society. Companies are in a unique position to support our
collective efforts by contributing to the three enablers.

24 One, invest in more carbon- and resource-efficient business processes. Achieving net zero will require enterprises to review all areas of your business, from
procurement to production. We hope to see more companies join in the pledge to achieve net zero. Notable home-grown companies such as City Developments Limited, Olam International, Singtel, and the Singapore Exchange are already on the world’s largest net zero coalition, the Race to Zero campaign.

25 Two, contribute to a culture of corporate transparency through clear and accountable reporting. Set impactful sustainability targets and lay out a clear
implementation plan to get there. The call on companies by investors and other stakeholders for transparent disclosure will only get stronger.

26 Three, invest in your workforce. Train them to gain an awareness and knowledge of sustainability-related topics and equip them with the requisite skills to
seize opportunities in this new economy.

27 Our distinguished guest speakers today will share their insights on how companies can grow and adapt in this transition. I hope that the insights and
discussions today will inspire you to set in motion, a just transition towards a low-carbon future for your businesses.

28 The time for action is now. As business leaders, you are key contributors to the success of our drive towards a low-carbon economy. I would like to therefore
urge you to embed the culture of sustainability in your companies and adopt more sustainable business practices, as well as encourage your stakeholders to integrate sustainability into their business operations. Together, we can grow Singapore into a green hub with enterprises that provide sustainable and profitable solutions to the world. I wish you all a fruitful day at CESG Catalyst 2023.
