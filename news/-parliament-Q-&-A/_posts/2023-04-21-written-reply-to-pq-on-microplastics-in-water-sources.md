#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Microplastics in Water Sources  by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng**: To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) whether any studies have been conducted on microplastics contamination in our reservoirs and water sources from foreign countries; and (b) whether there are any independent studies or data available locally on the intake of microplastics in Singapore and the potential health risks associated with it.

**Answer:**

1 PUB has conducted biennial surveillance of the level of microplastics in water from our Four National Taps, since 2017. The latest testing results in 2021 showed that microplastics were not detected in treated water, while microplastics counts in raw water sources (including reservoirs) remained low, at fewer than 10 particles per litre.

2 There have been no local studies done to date on microplastics intake and its health risks. PUB will continue to monitor international scientific developments on this issue.
