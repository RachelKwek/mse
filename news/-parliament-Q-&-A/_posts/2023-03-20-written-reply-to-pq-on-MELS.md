#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether there are plans to expand the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme to include other household appliances with significant energy consumption such as dishwashers and water heaters.

**Answer:**

1 The National Environment Agency (NEA) regularly reviews the list of household appliances under the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme, taking into consideration factors such as the energy consumption of an appliance, how widely it is used, and the availability of energy efficient models. The scheme has recently been expanded to include portable air-conditioners and more types of lamps, and we will continue to assess the feasibility of including other household appliances.
