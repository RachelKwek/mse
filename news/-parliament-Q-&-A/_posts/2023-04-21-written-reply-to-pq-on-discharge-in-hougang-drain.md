#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Discharge found in Hougang Drain by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what are the contents of the milky white discharge found in an outlet drain along Hougang Avenue 10 on 27 March 2023; (b) where is the exact source of the discharge; (c) what has caused the discharge to enter the waterways; and (d) what enforcement action has been or will be taken against the entity responsible for the discharge.

**Answer:**

1 PUBâ€™s investigations traced the white discharge seen in the Hougang Avenue 10 outlet drain on 27 March 2023 to paint products used at a construction site in Serangoon North. PUB had directed the site contractor to clean up all remnants of the white discharge from the drains. We are unable to provide further information on this case as investigations are ongoing.

2 We take a serious view of pollution to our waterways. Appropriate enforcement action will be taken against those found to have contravened the Environmental Protection and Management Act.
