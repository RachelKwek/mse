#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Lifespan of Semakau Landfill by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what is the current utilisation of Semakau Landfill; and (b) what is its estimated remaining capacity by number of tonnes of waste.

**Answer:**

1 As indicated in MSEâ€™s replies to recent parliamentary questions, at current waste disposal rates, Semakau Landfill is expected to run out of space by 2035. There are ongoing efforts to extend the lifespan of the Landfill well beyond 2035, including regulatory measures on key waste streams, research and development, public outreach and engagement. We will provide an update at a suitable time when we have greater certainty of our plans.
