#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Feedback on Secondhand Smoke in Homes by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment for each year in the past five years (a) what percentage of feedback on secondhand smoke in homes are resolved; and (b) what percentage of feedback on secondhand smoke in homes are repeated feedback.

1 Based on NEAâ€™s feedback data between 2018 to 2021 on smoking in homes, most of the feedback cases did not recur after advisories had been issued to residents in the surrounding units. Fewer than 10% of feedback providers gave further feedback on smoking in homes within a year.
