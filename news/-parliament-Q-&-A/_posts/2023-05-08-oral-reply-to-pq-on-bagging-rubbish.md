#### Oral Reply to Parliamentary Question on Public Awareness Campaign on Bagging Rubbish by Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment in light of the introduction of the plastic bag levy, whether the Ministry will consider working with HDB on a public awareness campaign reminding residents of the need to bag rubbish for disposal in rubbish chutes.

**Answer:**

1 The disposable carrier bag charge at supermarkets is intended to be a behavioural nudge, to encourage the use of reusables over disposables. The charge will not remove the publicâ€™s access to disposable bags. Residents should continue the responsible practice of bagging waste before disposal. We have and will continue to offer suggestions on alternatives to disposable carrier bags from supermarkets for bagging waste.
