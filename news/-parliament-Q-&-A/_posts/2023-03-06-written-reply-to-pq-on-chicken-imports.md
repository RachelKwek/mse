#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Chicken Imports by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment (a) what proportion of our chicken meat products now come from Indonesia after last year's approval of Indonesian producers to export to Singapore; and (b) whether there are any plans to streamline import processes for more countries that export meats to Singapore.

**Answer:**

The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) accredited Indonesia as a new source of chilled, frozen, and processed chicken meat in June 2022. It will take time for the industry to grow the amount of chicken imports from Indonesia. SFA's regulatory processes for meat imports serve to ensure our food remains safe. There are currently no plans to change these processes even as we work with foreign counterparts and the industry to diversify the sources of our protein imports.
