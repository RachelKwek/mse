#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Processes for E-waste Management by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Ms He Ting Ru:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether NEA has conducted any external checks to audit the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) processes for E-waste management that was introduced in July 2021.

**Answer:**

1 There are four groups of stakeholders regulated under the Extended Producer Responsibility scheme for e-waste: producers, which are manufacturers and importers of electrical and electronic products; the Producer Responsibility Scheme (PRS) operator; large retailers of electrical and electronic products; and e-waste recyclers.

2 Producers are required to submit data to NEA on the weight of products supplied annually. Producers who supply above a prescribed threshold are required to join the PRS and pay fees to the PRS operator, who will collect e-waste disposed of by the public for recycling by licensed e-waste recyclers. NEA conducts audits on the data submitted by producers.

3 The PRS operator must meet licencing requirements and service standards. NEA monitors key aspects of its operations, such as the deployment of e-waste recycling points, timely collection of e-waste, and management of public feedback. NEA audits the data submitted by the PRS operator on the amount of e-waste collected and sent for recycling.

4 Retailers are required to provide in-store e-waste collection services and free 1-for-1 takeback of old appliances when consumers purchase new appliances. NEA conducts inspections of retailersâ€™ premises, and together with the PRS operator, monitors their collection performance.

5 NEA also audits the recycling data submitted by e-waste recyclers and inspects their premises to ensure that they recycle e-waste in an environmentally sustainable manner and meet material recovery targets.

6 My Ministry will continue to monitor and audit the management of e-waste by the above stakeholders under the EPR.
