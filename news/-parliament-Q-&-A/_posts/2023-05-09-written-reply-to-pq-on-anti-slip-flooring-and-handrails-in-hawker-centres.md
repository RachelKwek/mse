#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Anti-slip Flooring and Handrails in Hawker Centres by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Leon Perera:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment whether NEA will consider installing anti-slip flooring and having more handrails in NEA hawker centres or coffee shops where there is some exposure to rainfall.

**Answer:**

1 Slip-resistant floor tiles, as well as railings for staircases and ramps, have been installed at hawker centres under the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme and for all new and redeveloped hawker centres. The National Environment Agency replaces worn out floor tiles and installs additional safety railings at MSE-owned hawker centres as and when necessary. For HDB-owned centres, such maintenance works are under the responsibility of Town Councils.
