#### Written Reply to Parliamentary Question on Transparent Recycling Bin Pilots by Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment

**Mr Yip Hon Weng:** To ask the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment referring to the Report on Transparent Recycling Bin Pilots published on 6 April 2023 (a) why are contamination rates higher in Bedok than in Bukit Batok; (b) whether the Ministry will expand the pilots to include a wider range of resident profiles over a longer time period; (c) whether the Ministry will test segregated transparent bins in areas with high pedestrian footfall; and (d) whether similar studies have been done overseas and what can Singapore learn from such studies.

**Answer:**

1 The findings from the pilots are inconclusive and do not provide further insight into the differences in contamination rates at each location.

2 Although there have been similar studies in other countries such as Greece and the United States of America on reducing contamination, it is not feasible to make a fair comparison. Different countries have different waste collection methodologies and control measures. Hence, solutions that work overseas may not be applicable to our local context.

3 We have implemented and are working on various initiatives to recover cleaner waste streams to raise recycling rates and reduce contamination rates. These include Extended Producer Responsibility schemes for e-Waste and beverage containers to segregate recyclables. We have also required large food waste producers to segregate, treat and report food waste generated. As such, the Ministry has no immediate plans to expand the transparent recycling bin pilots.
