MS GRACE FU  

MINISTER FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

1 Sustainability has always been part of Singapore’s development journey as we set out to create a clean, green, and liveable environment amid Singapore’s urban transformation. Through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we renewed our commitment to put sustainability and resilience at the heart of our plans, to build a future-ready Singapore that continues to thrive in a world characterised by climate change, resource constraints, and growing uncertainties.   

2	The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) will continue working with Singaporeans to steward a sustainable and resilient Singapore for future generations, in line with aspirations conveyed through the Forward Singapore exercise.  

**Towards Net Zero** 

3	The Singapore Green Plan charts out concrete policies and actions for Singapore to decarbonise and achieve our net-zero ambition, and how the Government, businesses, community, and individuals can work together towards a greener future. The Government will enable this green transition by working with all segments of society to change our mindsets, habits, and behaviours, and supporting the creation of new sustainable business models and green jobs.  

**Decarbonisation Efforts**

4	To accelerate our low-carbon transition, the carbon tax will be raised progressively from $5 per tonne now to $50 – $80 per tonne by 2030. To ensure an inclusive transition, we will continue supporting enterprises and households to become more energy-efficient and reduce their carbon footprint, through schemes like the Energy Efficiency Fund and Climate Friendly Households Programme. We will continue to advance effective international collaboration to support our decarbonisation efforts, such as in carbon markets, carbon capture usage and storage, a regional power grid, and renewable energy.  

**Public Sector Takes the Lead through GreenGov.SG**

5	Through GreenGov.SG, MSE will drive public sector efforts to achieve net-zero emissions around 2045, five years ahead of our national target. The Government will publish an annual GreenGov.SG report and Statutory Boards will disclose their environmental sustainability efforts, progress, and plans. The public sector will reduce its electricity and water consumption and waste generation, and further enhance its green procurement policies. 

**Towards a Zero-waste Culture**

6	Environmental stewardship means shifting away from a make-use-throw mindset, and embracing a circular economy and zero-waste culture. The Extended Producer Responsibility framework is an important enabler to encourage sustainable production upstream by requiring producers to be responsible for the collection and proper treatment of their products at end-of-life. Manufacturers and importers will need to reframe their thinking, redesign their business processes and products, and consider environmental externalities throughout the life cycle of their products.

**Keeping Singapore Resilient and Future-Ready** 

7	As a low-lying and densely built island nation, Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels and rising temperatures. To adapt to increased flood risk, we will continue to enhance the effectiveness of our drainage network, and put in place multi-functional adaptation infrastructure for Singapore’s coastlines. To preserve liveability amidst rising temperatures, the Government will expand our urban heat mitigation measures by increasing greenery and using cool paints. We will develop solutions collaboratively through public consultations and dialogue sessions.

8	We will increase our food resilience by diversifying our food import sources and continuing to ramp up local food production capabilities and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030. This includes increasing the adoption of productive technologies and sustainable farming practices, making better use of land and sea spaces for agriculture and aquaculture, and encouraging demand for local produce.

9	Climate change will also raise the risk of vector-borne diseases like dengue and pose challenges to public health. We will continue to safeguard Singapore’s public health through vector control and risk surveillance. We will continue to pilot, evaluate and scale new innovative solutions such as Project Wolbachia.

10	We will invest in new capabilities to realise our sustainability ambitions and raise our national resilience. We have introduced or stepped-up research and development programmes in areas such as decarbonisation, agri-food production, urban heat mitigation, coastal protection, and vector control, in partnership with both local and foreign companies and Institutes of Higher Learning. We will test-bed and implement innovative technologies, such as solar panels on reservoirs, and synergistic waste-to-energy at the Tuas Nexus. These efforts will be supported and sustained by a pipeline of local talent. 

**Environmental Stewardship as a Shared Responsibility** 

11	The Singapore Green Plan is supported by a growing movement of individuals, community groups, and businesses wishing to build a more sustainable and resilient Singapore. Through Forward Singapore, the community, public, and private sectors have discussed how we can, as a society, foster a more sustainable way of life, and steward our environmental resources responsibly for future generations. For example, the Green Action for Communities movement brings together community leaders and residents to co-create and co-implement sustainability initiatives that impact their communities directly. We will also continue to support community-led environmental sustainability projects through the SG Eco Fund. 

**Forging a New Social Compact**

12	Building a sustainable, resilient, and future-ready Singapore requires everyone to play a part. Our convictions must translate to tangible action. We must change our mindsets, lifestyles, and habits to build a more resilient and sustainable Singapore.
