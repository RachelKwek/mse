### **Our Organisational Practices**

**Environmental Health & Safety and Corporate Social Responsibility**

At MSE, we recognise our personal responsibility towards the community and the environment. On top of striving towards environmental sustainability, we hope to help the less fortunate by making a positive difference in their lives.

Our commitment towards charity, community involvement and environmental activities is expressed through:

Our support of the President's Challenge through annual fundraisers such as the Vertical Challenge, and participation in the Community Chest SHARE Programme
Our provision of time off (up to 2 days a year) for staff to follow their hearts in helping the less fortunate through participation in individually-driven community involvement activities
Our contribution towards environmental sustainability such as clean-up activities, and adopting environmentally-friendly best practices for all our events.

At MSE, we endeavour to create an organisational culture where resource conservation, health and safety at the workplace is second nature.

We view our commitment to environmental protection and enhancement, health and safety seriously and desire to do our part in preserving the environment for future generations.

Apart from instilling awareness in MSE staff, we take ownership by being active in pursuing safe, environmentally friendly resources to meet our organisational needs:

**Green Procurement and Partnership with Suppliers**

**Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**
-   We use our resources efficiently to reduce wastage.
-   We develop innovative ways to reuse our resources.
-   We promote opportunities to recycle.

**Efficiency**
